# multi-class-classification
During this lab, I learned to apply multi-class classification to a dataset with the aim of categorizing data into more than two categories. This involves preprocessing the data by addressing missing values, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing/normalizing the data.
Following the data preparation, an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand and visualize the dataset. Subsequently, we move on to the Deep Neural Network (DNN) stage. In our case, the DNN consists of a model, specifically a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), with a loss function represented by Cross-Entropy and an optimizer, where I used the Adam optimizer.
After data preparation and defining the model, the next steps include training the model and then evaluating its performance.
